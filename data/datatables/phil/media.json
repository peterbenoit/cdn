Most experts think that influenza viruses spread mainly through small droplets containing influenza virus. These droplets are expelled into the air when people infected with the flu, cough, sneeze or talk. Once in the air, these small infectious droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. This image shows what happens after these influenza viruses enter the human body. The viruses attach to cells within the nasal passages and throat, i.e., the respiratory tract. The influenza virus's hemagglutinin (HA) surface proteins then bind to the sialic acid receptors on the surface of a human respiratory tract cell. The structure of the influenza virus's HA surface proteins is designed to fit the sialic acid receptors of the human cell, like a key to a lock. Once the key enters the lock, the influenza virus is then able to enter and infect the cell. This marks the beginning of a flu infection. The cut-out box shows a close-up view of how an influenza virus's HA surface protein binds to a sialic acid on the surface of a human respiratory tract cell.","targetUrl":"https://phil.cdc.gov/details_linked.aspx?pid=15327","datePublished":"2019-11-26T11:58:00Z","enclosures":[{"id":6538900,"resourceUrl":"https://phil.cdc.gov//PHIL_Images/15327/15327_lores.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg","size":77864,"enclosureType":""}]},{"id":402665,"name":"14651","description":"Caption:This 2008 photograph depicted U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS), Cmdr.

Nipah virus causes inflammation of the brain and commonly leads to death. The sap can be contaminated with saliva, urine and feces from bats that carry the disease.

A neotropical tick, A. triste is a member of the Ixodides family of hard ticks, whose dorsal abdominal surface is covered by a hard, chitinous shell known as a scutum. Marked by a symmetrical reticulated pattern, as in the case of this male tick, the scutum covers the entire dorsal abdominal surface.  However, as you can plainly see in the case of the female (PHIL 10880), her scutum is much smaller, allowing for the expansion of her abdomen, which becomes engorged when ingesting her blood meal.","targetUrl":"https://phil.cdc.gov/details_linked.aspx?pid=10881","datePublished":"2019-04-19T09:51:00Z","enclosures":[{"id":6524805,"resourceUrl":"https://phil.cdc.gov//PHIL_Images/10881/10881_lores.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg","size":34323,"enclosureType":""}]},{"id":397482,"name":"22482","description":"Entitled, \"Plague in Madagascar\", this image was captured by EIS Officer, Boris Pavlin, MD, in the Special Pathogens Branch, DVRD.
